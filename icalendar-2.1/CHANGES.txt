2.1 (2009-12-14)
================

* Fix deprecation warnings about `object.__init__` taking no parameters.

* Set the VALUE parameter correctly for date values.

* Long binary data would be base64 encoded with newlines, which made the
  iCalendar files incorrect. (This still needs testing).

* Correctly handle content lines which include newlines.

iCalendar 2.0.1 (2008-07-11)
============================

* EXDATE and RDATE now returns a vDDDLists object, which contains a list
  of vDDDTypes objects. This is do that EXDATE and RDATE can contain
  lists of dates, as per RFC.
  
  ***Note!***: This change is incompatible with earlier behavior, so if you
  handle EXDATE and RDATE you will need to update your code.

* When createing a vDuration of -5 hours (which in itself is nonsensical),
  the ical output of that was -P1DT19H, which is correct, but ugly. Now
  it's '-PT5H', which is prettier.

* Made the tests run under Python 2.5+

* Renamed the UTC class to Utc, so it would not clash with the UTC object,
  since that rendered the UTC object unpicklable.
