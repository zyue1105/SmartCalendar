VCo-founders of Food for Black Thought Naya Jones and Kevin Thomas host this installment of MEC Cinema and facilitate a discussion following the screening of "Soul Food Junkies," a documentary that looks at the effects of "soul food" on African Americans and others.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInspired by his own family's complex relationship with "soul food" - fried chicken, ribs, macaroni and cheese, peach cobbler and the whole panoply of down-home foods made with grease, sugar and love - acclaimed filmmaker Byron Hurt asks whether this diet is nurturing or destroying the African American community. With humor and heart, Hurt questions the effects of "soul food" on the health of not only African Americans, but all who guiltily consume this most comforting of American comfort foods.\u000a\u000aSource\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/events/224915407640151/
