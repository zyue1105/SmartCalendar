VThe Visual Arts Center, in collaboration with the art publication Pastelegram, presents the fall 2012 edition of "Two Ships Passing" on the topic of sound art with invitee Barbara Perea, a Mexico City-based curator, critic and lecturer with a concentration in emerging media, sound and video art.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aStraddling the worlds of contemporary visual art and music, sound art includes diverse practices, from inventive machines, video and film, to performance and other possibilities. Sound art's boundaries are thus amorphous, posing particular complexities to those who wish to display such works or write about the field. These issues form the basis from which Barbara Perea, this edition's invitee, begins her conversation.\u000a\u000aSource\u000ahttp://utvac.org/programs/two-ships-passing-barbara-perea-mexico-city-based-curator
