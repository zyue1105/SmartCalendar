In Italian with ITALIAN subtitles.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen accepted into a music festival, Nicola and his band decide that a 10-day cross-country journey on foot will act as a publicity-seeking, chemistry-building exercise from which the band can only emerge better off. Predictably, the end of the characters' odd journey from one sea to another turns out to be not as important as the journey itself, through which they will evolve and learn much about themselves and the meaning of their lives.
