Film Series Presents: 
Mexican cinema 

Los Olvidados (1950) 
by Luis Buy?uel 

Monday October 1 2007 
7:30pm in CAL 100 
Sponsored by the GSO 

In his exile through Mexico, the father of surreal cinema, 
Luis BuyDC?uel (1900-1983), created one of the best motion-pictures in film 
history: the Mexican nonrealistic film entitled "Los olvidados" (The 
Forgotten Ones). The movie depicts the lives of two boys, surviving 
in the streets of a developing Mexico City. It is the story of the fatality of destiny, the absurdity, and irrationality of life itself. 

This 1950's film was recognized in Cannes as the best-directed movie, and is also in second place among the best 100 Mexican Films.

	<title>Department of Spanish and Protuguese presents film series</title>
	<description>	
From the dark comedic mind of Mexican director Alejandro Lozano comes 
Matando Cabos (Noose Ends, 2004), a comedy that keeps you just where 
you should be: knowing everything but with no idea of what's going on 
next. A tale of misunderstandings from the misunderstood, fallen 
legends, and those who dare tamper with them.

	<title>University departments screen "The Unknown Soldier"</title>
	<description>	
	Can we silence the ghosts of history? The Wehrmacht-Exhibition, which was shown in 11 major cities in Germany between 1999 and 2004 and was visited by more than 500,000 people, challenged ordinary Germans to rethink what their fathers and grandfathers did during the war. Whereas most had been led to believe that the cold-blooded murder of civilians had been a crime of a minority of officers, for the first time Germans saw photos and footage of ordinary soldiers executing civilians and POWs. The nation was shaken, and large protests were organized by those who believed the evidence was manufactured. In "The Unknown Soldier," director Michael Verhoeven interviews historians and experts, including those who allege or deny the crimes, and filmed in the killing fields of Ukraine and White Russia.
